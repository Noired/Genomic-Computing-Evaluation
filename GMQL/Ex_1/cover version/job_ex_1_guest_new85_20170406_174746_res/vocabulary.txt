	Histone H3 (acetyl K27). As with H3K9ac, associated with transcriptional initiation and open chromatin structure. It remains unknown whether acetylation has can have different consequences depending on the specific lysine residue targeted. In general, though, there appears to be high redundancy. Histone acetylation is notable for susceptibility to small molecules and drugs that target histone deacetylases.	1
